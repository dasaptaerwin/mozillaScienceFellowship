# LETTER OF SUPPORT

My name is Dr. Prihadi Sumintadireja (Assoc.Prof.). I am writing this letter as supervisor of Dr. Dasapta Erwin Irawan from the Department of Geology, Faculty of Earth Sciences and Technology, Institut Teknologi Bandung. 
I am offering full support to Dr. Erwin to apply for Mozilla Science Fellowship Program on the basis of the following aspects: 

1.	I have known him for 10 years now and I shall say that he is one of the promising lecturer and researcher in our institution. He has been working in a team within our unit and under my direct supervision for his PhD (2005-2009) and several research programs. 
2.	During his working period, he also had shown commendable academic and organizational skills. I strongly believe that he is a valuable asset for our faculty. 
3.	He is also a passionate person in education system development. He has actively self-organized workshops in open science implementation and open source tools not for our students and staffs, but also for students and staffs at university level.

Hopefully, you will give him the opportunity to proof those qualities I mentioned about him in person as Mozilla Science Fellow.
Thank you for your kind attention.

Respectfully,
Dr. Prihadi Sumintadireja
