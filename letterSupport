# Letter of support 

My name is Dr. Prihadi Sumintadireja (Assoc.Prof.). I am the Head of Department of Groundwater Engineering (Master Program) in the Faculty of Earth Sciences and Technology, Institut Teknologi Bandung. Along with this letter, I would like to recommend Dr. D. Erwin Irawan to apply for Project Coordinator vacancy in the University of Sydney. 
I have known Erwin for 10 years now and I shall say that he is one of the promising lecturer and researcher in our institution. He has been working in a team within our unit and under my direct supervision for his PhD (2005-2009) and several research programs. During his working period, he also had shown commendable academic and organizational skills. I strongly believe that he is a valuable asset for our faculty. For the period of those extensive working hours I have spent with him, he has also shown good personality, which had helped him collaborate smoothly with his team and counterparts in other institutions. Currently he is also appointed as Coordinator for Collaboration in the Faculty of Earth Sciences and Technology, and he has worked on several important collaborations. 
Hopefully, you will give him the opportunity to proof those qualities I mentioned about him in person.
Thank you for your kind attention.
