## What research fields are you in? (25 words) *
>My research fields are hydrogeology, hydrochemistry, and multivariate statistics.  

## What is your research focus? (50 words)
>My research focus is applying multivariate statistics to hydrochemical properties from groundwater samples to extract the hydrogeological processes. We use spatio-temporal dataset for this research and the application of open source tools, like R programming and QGIS. Our current and future vision is implementing open science principles in our work. 

## Describe to us your current research team. (50 words)
>Our research team consists of two PhD student (topics: hydrology controlled-landslide and hydrochemical clustering); four master students (topics: generating open data system for groundwater data points and clustering of geothermal dataset); four undergraduate students (topics: infiltration rate database of  volcanic areas and hydrological characterization based on morphometric analysis).

# YOUR RESEARCH

## Describe to us how open science advances your research. (100 words) 
>I am interested in Open Science because I believe it will attract more collaborations. And once we collaborate, new (unthinkable) results may arise. We need more collaborations in Indonesia, especially in my field of research (hydrogeology), in order to gather more knowledge, research culture, and research impact. In my perspective science should be done in openly manner for it to be reproduced, replicated, and reviewed. Good science is not valued  solely based on the quality of the analysis and interpretation, but also how it is disseminated to the community and how the community could use it for their own interests. 

## Are you leading any projects related to open science? (100 words) *
I am leading three projects this year. One is generating open data platform for groundwater dataset, building a clustering model of geothermal dataset, and designing an open access library repository for university's thesis database. 

## How do you see Mozilla advancing your work? (50 words) *
My participation in this program will surely enrich my knowledge and skill in order to nurture open science mind set of our staffs, to promote open library infrastructure for open open thesis/dissertation free access, and to initiate a set of open science regulation in the university and hopefully national scope. 

## What do you see as the opportunities for impact around open research at your university? Could you leverage this opportunity in a potential project? (50 words) *
Our university now is promoting more collaborations via networking initiatives. In my view, this can  be triggered by endorsing open science among academic staffs. Therefore more curiosity from collaborators can be linked together in form of research collaboration. In time, this effort should lead to more publications and more citations.    

## What do you think needs to change most immediately in scientific research? (100 words) *
It is the openness in scientific life that has to be changed immediately. The nature of publishing research results is evolving. Publishing papers are now not the one thing to do, but make all the data, methods, and analysis to public are the next best thing. We should nurture the nature of "publish and publicize" in our academic environment in order to speed up the development of science. The second would be the evolving infrastructure from static to dynamic form. The third would evolving organization from closed to open system, where all academic society can contribute their expertise and knowledge. 

## What project in the field do you find most inspiring to further science and the web? (50 words) *
I have three most inspiring open projects: (1) Linux OS; (2) Github; (3) PLOS journal. Those three projects must be called souvenirs for the next generation. All three have nourished best practices of openness, collaboration, and documentation. That science is meant to be shared and developed not owned and mummified. 

## Why is the the open web important to you? (25 words) * 
It is important because it promotes reproducibility and replicability as the basis of open science. It promotes more results based on the same core  resources.
