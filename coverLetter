Dear Mozilla Science Fellowship Committee,

I am lecturer and researcher at Department of Geology, Faculty of Earth Sciences and Technology, Institut Teknologi Bandung (Indonesia) and am applying for Mozilla Science Fellowship program. 

My application is written based on my experience in promoting open science in my research activities and also the needs of my university to gain more collaborations. Therefore my participation in this fellowship will be very useful to the development of hydrogeological science, as well as the promoting openness in university-wide academic life.

For your considerations, I am also attaching the letter of support from my supervisor and my complete resume. 

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Dr. Dasapta Erwin Irawan
